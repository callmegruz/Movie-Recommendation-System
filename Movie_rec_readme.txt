Hybrid Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview
This project is a hybrid movie recommendation system developed using the MovieLens 1M dataset. The system combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized and accurate movie recommendations. A user-friendly interface has been developed to enhance the interaction with the system.

Key Features:
Hybrid Recommendation Model: Combines content-based filtering (movie features) and collaborative filtering (user preferences) to generate precise movie recommendations.
Personalized Suggestions: The model delivers movie suggestions tailored to the user's viewing history and preferences.
User Interface: The project comes with a designed interface for better user interaction, hosted via an external UI platform, though users can use their own hosting solution.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
2. Install Dependencies
Move into the project folder and install the required dependencies. These can be installed using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare and Train the Model
Youâ€™ll first need to train the collaborative filtering model. The collaborative filtering model allows personalized movie suggestions based on user interactions with the dataset.

Open the relevant Jupyter notebook or Python script that handles the model training:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook collaborative_model.ipynb
After training the model, save it locally for future use so that you don't have to retrain it each time. Use the following code to save the trained model:

python
Copy code
model.save('collaborative_model.h5')
Make sure the saved model is placed in the correct directory so that it can be loaded by the application when running.

4. Run the Application Interface
The project also includes a user interface where users can interact with the movie recommendation system. The UI is hosted externally, but you can use your own hosting platform if preferred.

To run the application locally:

Make sure the pre-trained collaborative model is stored in the correct location.
Run the project_app.ipynb or the appropriate Python script that starts the UI:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook project_app.ipynb
If using the external UI host, you can follow the instructions in the file to interact with the system directly through the provided host.
If you prefer to host the interface locally, you can modify the necessary configurations to point to your own server or hosting platform.
5. Load the Pre-Trained Model
When running the app, the saved collaborative model will be loaded to provide movie recommendations. Ensure that the correct path to the saved model (collaborative_model.h5) is specified in the project_app.ipynb or relevant files.

6. Customize the Model and UI
Model Customization: You can retrain the model with different configurations or datasets by adjusting parameters in collaborative_model.ipynb.
UI Customization: Developers can use their own UI host by modifying the project_app.ipynb to point to their local or external host of choice.
7. Future Enhancements
You can further enhance the system by:

Integrating new recommendation techniques (e.g., neural collaborative filtering).
Improving the user interface for better user experience.
